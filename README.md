# Rust-in-Ethereum
Demonstration for Rust language features with code snippets from reth and lighthouse Ethereum clients.

Dear Rustaceans,

I'm a backend developer with years of experience, mainly using Rust and C++. Recently, I found my interests in blockchain development with Rust, so I decided to work on this project to collect snippets from two of my favorite Rust Ethereum projects:

### Lighthouse, the dominant Ethereum consensus client

https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/

https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse

### reth, the rising Ethereum execution client

https://reth.rs/

https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth

I hope this project could become:

- A well-rounded demonstration of Rust language features, from fundamental to advanced.
- A kick-starter in Ethereum or blockchain development for those with Rust skills.
- A collection of good codes that can be used as a quick reference.

Any forms of contribution are welcomed! Thanks for your attention, enjoy, and be patient!
